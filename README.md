# my-first-starter-program
Here is my first project showcasing a copy of my classes schedule. There is an HTML and CSS file and there is no JS included in this project because it is a simple project. 
I used basic HTML tags like table, th, td, tr and basic css with flex properties.
I used to made this page to test my skills and to check if i can create a copy of an image and there was nothing in mind so i look upon on my university schedule.
------ The file that is copied is saved in repository with name sample.image (jpg)----------------------
